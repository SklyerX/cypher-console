### Introduction

An open source end-to-end encrypted key management platform for developers to ecnrypt data in their apps.

Cypher has been designed for developers to easily encrypt and decrypt data in their apps. Cypher allows you to manage keys and also know if an interaction was made by someone who you did not authorize. It allows for better DX when working in backend.

#### Technology

Cypher is built on the [NodeJS crypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html) api and the [json web tokens](https://jwt.io) package.

#### Why?

The reason we use the combonation of `crypto nodejs` and `jwt` is to offer more security and flexablitiy. We use the JWT library/package to generate keys and output values but the core behind it uses the built in NodeJS crypto API.

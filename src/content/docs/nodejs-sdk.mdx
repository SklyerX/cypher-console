### Node.js SDK

SDK to integrate Phase in server-side applications running Node.js.

The Node.js SDK allows you to encrypt data server-side, as well as decrypt data.

- [@sklyerx/cypher](https://npmjs.org/sklyerx/cypher)
- [github.com/SkylerX/cypher-nodejs-sdk](https://github.org/SkylerX/cypher-nodejs-sdk)

<br />

<Alert text="In order to use the Node.js sdk you will need to create an account and add a new app. You require the APP_ID, APP_SECRET, and JWT_SECRET in order to properly use the app" />

---

#### Install the SDK

The Node.js SDK is distributed via [npm](https://npmjs.org). You can install it using the following command for your preferred package manager.

```
npm install @sklyerx/cypher
```

---

#### Import the SDK

Once installed, you can import the Node.js SDK into your project.

```js
const Cypher = require("@sklyerx/cypher");
```

<strong>ESM</strong>

```js
import Cypher from "@sklyerx/cypher";
```

---

#### Initialize the SDK

initialize the SDK with your `APP_ID`, `APP_SECRET`, and `JWT_SECRET`

```js
const cypher = new Cypher({
  appId: APP_ID,
  appSecret: APP_SECRET,
  JWT_SECRET: JWT_SECRET,
});
```

---

#### Usage

#### Encrypt

The `encrypt` API allows you to encrypt data. It returns an encrypted string in the Cypher format.

```js
const ciphertext = cypher.encrypt("hello world");
```

#### Decrypt

The `decrypt` API allows you to decrypt data the encrypted data as long as you have it in the `Cypher Format` and you have the correct credentials.

```js
const plaintext = await phase.decrypt(ciphertext);
```
